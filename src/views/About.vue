      I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a
      bachelors in Economics and a Masters of Science in Information Technology
      Management. Both my bachelors and masters degree have been a great asset
      to me in saturating my passions through technology, business, and
      mathematics while gaining valuable experience solving real world problems.
      Throughout my college education, I have gained a foundational
      understanding in both quantitative and qualitative points of views,
      allowing me to think abstractly when developing solutions.

        While attending UT I have had the privilege to serve as the Fundraising
        officer, Vice President, and now currently the President of Texas
        Rotaract, a non-profit organization serving under the standards of the
        Rotary International Club. Our organization has developed a welcoming
        space for a diverse group of students to serve Austinâ€™s local community
        in any way possible including trash pickups, garden restorations, food
        deliveries, school events, and much more. Along with school related
        activities, I also practice brazillian jiu jitsu; Coming from a
        wrestling background jiu jitsu has been a great way for me to continue
        practicing martial arts and stay active during University.
