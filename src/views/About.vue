      I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a
      bachelors in Economics and a Masters of Science in Information Technology
      Management with the McCombs School of Business. Both my bachelors and
      masters degree have been a great asset to me in saturating my passions
      through technology, business, and mathematics while gaining valuable
      experience solving real world problems. Throughout my college education, I
      have gained a foundational understanding in both quantitative and
      qualitative points of views, allowing me to think abstractly when
      developing solutions.

        While attending UT I have had the privilege to serve as the Fundraising
        Officer, Vice President, and now currently the President of Texas
        Rotaract, a non-profit organization serving under the standards of the
        Rotary International Club. Our organization has developed a welcoming
        space for a diverse group of students to serve Austinâ€™s local community
        in any way possible including trash pickups, garden restorations, food
        deliveries, school events, and much more. Along with school-related
        activities, I also practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu and dabble in
        photography; Coming from a wrestling background, jiu-jitsu has been a
        great way for me to continue practicing martial arts and stay active
        during University, while photography allows me the opportunity to
        express my creativity through a lens of a camera and share the images on
        my social media.
