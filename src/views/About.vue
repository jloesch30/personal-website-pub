        I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a
        bachelors in Economics and a Masters of Science in Information
        Technology Management with the McCombs School of Business. Both my
        bachelors and masters degree have been a great asset to me in saturating
        my passions through technology, business, and mathematics while gaining
        valuable experience solving real world problems. Throughout my college
        education, I have gained a foundational understanding in both
        quantitative and qualitative points of views, allowing me to think
        abstractly when developing solutions.

          While attending UT I have had the privilege to serve as the
          Fundraising Officer, Vice President, and now currently the President
          of Texas Rotaract, a non-profit organization serving under the
          standards of the Rotary International Club. Our organization has
          developed a welcoming space for a diverse group of students to serve
          Austinâ€™s local community in any way possible including trash pickups,
          garden restorations, food deliveries, school events, and much more.
          Along with school-related activities, I also practice Brazilian
          jiu-jitsu and dabble in photography; Coming from a wrestling
          background, jiu-jitsu has been a great way for me to continue
          practicing martial arts and stay active during University, while
          photography allows me the opportunity to express my creativity through
          a lens of a camera and share the images on my social media.
